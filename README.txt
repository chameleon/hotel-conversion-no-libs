2) public-no-libs --- has a vanilla javascript version (works in IE/Edge/)  The instructions mentioned making the page load as fast as possible.  The html/css/js code is 35k unminified.  The total browser download is 115k.
Just change the names of the folders to 'public' the see what node is serving text and images from.

-The page validates, is accessivble and semantic.  I tested both version in Chrome and Firefox (Mac) and IE11, Edge, Chrome and Firefox (Windows).
